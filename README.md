Supplementary data legend
Supplementary data1. DNA data sets used to test MOLD, and standard MOLD rDNC output files, when DNA diagnoses were recovered for all taxa of a dataset.
Supplementary data2. Reproducibility of the MOLD output. The files MolD_rDNCx10.py and MolD_rDNCx30.py are the python scripts used to perform iterated diagnosis recovery. The Directories x10 and x30 contain the respective output files. The script Plot_rDNCx30.py was used to plot the obtained results.
Supplementary data3. Comparison of MOLD and other software to recover DNA diagnoses. The directory contains results of MOLD runs with mDNC output.
Supplementary data4. H-sampling script and mDNC output files.
Supplementary data5. H-sampling script and rDNC output files.
Supplementary data5. Hspp-sampling script and rDNC output files.
